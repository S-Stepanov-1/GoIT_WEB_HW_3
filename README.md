# GoIT_WEB_HW_3
Individual homework #3 in GoIT school (Python WEB) 


## Description

### Multithreading folder' sorter
**Folder 3.1** contains files related to the first part of the homework. 
The user must give the program the path to the folder where he wants to sort the files. Then 6 folders `archives`, `video`, `audio`, `documents`, `images` and `other_formats` will be created in the specified folder and all files will be sorted into these folders according to their format.
This program uses the module **multithreading**.

### Number factorization
**Folder 3.2** contains files, each of which performs the factorization of numbers from the list. In the __factorize.py__ file the factorization is performed on a single core, while in file __multiprocessing_factorize.py__ the factorization is performed in parallel on several processor cores. In the picture you can see the execution time for both of these programs using the same raw data.
